Synopsis:
Jean Dutourd's A Dog's Head is a wonderful piece of magical realism, reminiscent of Voltaire, orges and Kafka. With biting wit, Dutourd presents the story of Edmund Du Chaillu, a boy born, to his bourgeois parents's horror, with the head of a spaniel. Edmund must endure his school-mate's teasing as well as an urge to carry a newspaper in his mouth. This is the story of his life, trials, and joys as he searches for a normal life of worth and love.",,

It's a beautiful Saturday morning as he came to work whistling through Times Square on his Vespa.

Shep saw a play last night - ""The Man in the Dog Suit"" by Hume Cronyn

Looking back at the ruins of your life. Someone should blow a trumpet in your ear whenever you reach a momentous point in your life.

Walking through Goldblatt's dept store looking at the 'remainder' books. He bought 3 of them. ""Animal Farm"" by George Orwell; ""Mistress Masham's Repose"" by T.H. White, and an un-named 3rd book. Later claims to have changed his course in college because of these books he bought.

Bruce the engineer comes into the studio and Shep tells him to do what he has to do and Bruce says ""I don't know what I am supposed to do.""
-- break for Grand Union commercial and WOR ID --
Shep asks 'What am I supposed to do?'

Monsters and the abominable snowman.

After commercials, Shep reads the local traffic reports - sponsored by Chrysler

The Golden Hamster Hoax - Mr. Bruner answers an ad for fun and profit by selling golden hamsters during the depression. He never made a cent.

Other ads - How to make your own Tesla Coil and Fleischmann's Yeast for the complexion.

""Speaking of rubble strewn roads..."" - Volvo commercial - Shep says he spent all day Thursday at Yonkers Raceway driving the new Volvo.

Engineer Phil brings Shep coffee.

According to NY Times the 1959 new car designs from Detroit are making matters difficult for the car washes - may cost $500 per car wash to modify equipment.

'Does anybody know where I can get a new nose flute? Martha Deane stepped on mine!'

Shep going to Village Gate concert on the 9th - see ad below

I'm doing it because I like it.

'My Heart's in the Highlands' at 'Theatre Club' - E 30th st over ""Cedars"" Lebanese Restaurant

Phil leaves followed by commercials and Shep reading the traffic reports again.

We're in the middle of a big election campaign. Each side points the finger at the other side and how bad it will be if they get in. (Nothing seems to have changed in 50 years!) Shep talks politics in general - wouldn't it be great if the candidates ran on philosophy?

""Speaking of falling apart, we have a new sponsor...""
First a Volvo commercial and then the new sponsor - 
Electronic Workshop (see ad below)
Shep raves about them - how they are owned by a Harvard trained physicist - Clifton Howard. Shep says he owns a MacIntosh 60watt amplifier, a MacIntosh C-8 pre-amp and mixer, and a Garrard 300 turntable.

People sitting in front of the TV or movie screen and believing this utter drivel and going away feeling warm inside - that it really was this way.

Driving through Times Square on his Vespa, noting the changes that take place over time when driving the same root. The changing marquees. There are so many things to do in this town. Shep has been to Paris, London, Brussels, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Dublin and there is no more exciting city as this city. New York is the capitol of the world - most people who live here don't know that and how long will it last until another city takes its place? 

Fine tuning the antenna to get a better picture.
Family had a Scott DX-10 radio (Note: probably meant AC-10 which was the popular model when he was a kid) The old man was constantly polishing the radio and cleaning it with carbon tetrachloride. He kept a log of all the stations he ever heard. The old man was an early Uncle Fletcher. (Vic and Sade)

Charlie Egelston died last week. He was a good friend of Shep's and for over 26 years played the part of Shuffle Shober on Ma Perkins.

Shep returns from the news break playing the nose flute to the theme. ""I feel better now!""

The car that makes history because it makes sense. It's getting to the point now where you can make history just if you make sense.

""...so 6000 years from now will you have known if you have ever lived? ... In the seventy years of your lifetime, do you, do you know or are you aware of the moment in your life when you are at your absolutely most complete and thorough, magnificent, your most magnificent - everything is the rightest that it will ever be - your physical being, your mental being, you are at the very apex of your career this moment. How long does this moment last? Do you know it?"" 

It's this dream that the next minute is going to see something more magnificent happen to them or they will be somehow greater or more heroic than they have ever been in their lives before.""

""There's a kid in the control room - he says YEAHH! By George I haven't seen a kid in years - there's a kid! They still have kids! Look at that - there's two kids in the control room! Live kids, in tree dimensions""
Shep invites him into the studio and asks him what he is doing here. The kid says ""To get your autograph"". Shep asks ""Do mothers still give motherly words of advice?"" The kid responds ""Yes, really, they do.""

""What a golden moment - a kid!... That little shrimp's got the history of the world and the future of the world in his hands. What a frightening thought.""

-- Commercials --

""We'll be here until noon here - this is Harold Everyman""

Shep side tracks into general banter backtracking to the first commercial and then discussing his role as ""Girth"" in Ivanhoe while in the 6th grade.

Shep tells the story of how he was in the northern Michigan woods and got up on a Saturday morning at 11:00 and it was as dark as if it were 11:00 at night. He turned on the radio and all seemed normal. He tried calling the operator and aside from a strange buzzing on the line everything was normal ather end.

Someday books will have commercials - everything is being packaged - even the weather. Everything now has to be fun, deoderized, and sprayed. New Yorker's fear the weather more than anybody else in the country.

Answering machines - all of a sudden the whole world is composed of robots.

Shep says that last night (11-21-1958) he was at the annual Humor Forum at the University of Pennsylvania with Shel Silverstein. There were about 1100 kids at the auditorium. 1 year ago the main question were about the prob. Of conformity, this year it is the opposite. 

In a week or two we are going up to Princeton.

Hoffritz commercial - Uncle Fletcher would have dug Hoffritz.

Continued discussion of Vic and Sade- 'What was the name of the movie house, the movie and who played in the movie?' (answered later during phone call)

Shep's aunt was entirely made of corsets and she creaked. She took Shep to a Johnny Weismueller & Maureen O'Sullivan movie (Tarzan). Shep is young and when the old professor dies Shep is stunned and isn't able to separate the picture from reality.

Shep reads a letter from a father about his kid who saw a Fu Man Cu movie. TV stations showing it because ""we are living in very periless times, strange times.""

Aladdin shoes vs round toe shoes. 
Shep wears a checkered shirt to WOR occasionally and takes a lot of heat.

Back to Vic and Sade - ""Bright Kentucky Hotel"" and the ""Sacred Sons of the Milky Way Lodge""

Pegine Fitzgerald calls in. She's a big Vic and Sade fan and theres more chatter about Vic and Sade. She answers Shep's earlier questions: The theatre was the Bijou Theatre playing ""Hearts of Flame"" starring Gloria Golden.

He also says ""This is the last show of 1959"" Since Thursday was the 
31st, then this broadcast would be the evening of  December 27 into the 28th of 1959. He never mentions it being midnight even though he does make reference  to the Holiday.

Easing back into the sack, there is a rustling sound out on the street. Looking out, there is a long dark mass of people moving to the end of the block, climbing down a manhole. They're wearing bathing suits and bathing caps, carrying weekend travel cases. 15 minutes later you're in your bathing suit and following them down the manhole. You are awakened by the phone. The editor of Life wants to do an 8 page picture story on you. You hang up, the phone rings again, the New York Times wants to do a Sunday supplement, the phone rings again, Charles Collinwood, a three part program. Finally the phone rings with a call from Jack (Kennedy) at the White House. Off the phone again and there's this gigantic watermelon - at long last you've tapped it.

Perhaps there was an incident where the film broke and began spewing onto the floor. Having been on a visual aids crew, that embarresment occurred quite frequently to me.

Building a philosophical box around yourself. When things get too involved man builds a box around him. This is why they move to the suburbs. They feel safety with the shutters and the lawn around. A man in Syracuse, New York commits suicide by sealing himself in a crate with only a flashlight.

He reads from James Thurber about the man and the box.

""And by the way. The box principle is also associated with extremism of many forms. The are many ways of building a a box to hide in. And in the end all you can say is...

The truthful perceptions of a sea captain who retires after years at sea - ""I hate it""  ""I'm afraid of the sea""

""Thousands of men walking with me - Life isn't exactly the way it seems to be - Men walking fast - They had a kind of dead look on their face""",Sometimes Shep is profound - this is one of those times.

There is a logic to everything - 
Driving a bed in England requires a plate with the letter ""L"" for learner, a braking system and proper insurance.

Man's wanting to know everything and seeing what it will do. Why does man make up reasons for wanting to do something instead of telling the truth? For example, to send up a rocket with a man in it is really just man's itch to throw things up as high as he can to see what would happen. (See Note 1)",1) Shep is referring to the 1st US orbital space flight by John Glenn taking place the next day (2-20-62),

""I'm this kid..."" It's June, living by the lakeside and starting to look at Ester Jane like he never had before. Shep, Paul, Flick, and Bollus get their work permits and land jobs at the Strabe Piano Company.
The job pays $9.90 a week working from 8 to 4:30 weekdays and 8 to 12:30 on Saturdays. Paul was assigned to 'tops dept', Bollus to the 'action dept' and Shep to the ""backs dept"". He doesn't say what flick did. 
In the backs department Shep works for Mr. Zudock who teaches him to cut, sand, and drill the backs of pianos. Zudock tells him to drill straight and fast, showing him how to measure with a T square that had the numbers worn off of.
Shep describes how the 'old timers' would come in early to set up and leave late, after cleaning up the shop.  
After a week of work, Friday comes, PAYDAY! He gets his first paycheck for $9.81, 9 cents taken out for taxes. After the second week he has $15.00. His mother made him pay $2.00 a week for board now that he had a job. Shep decides he wants to buy a bike and so the next Saturday, the family goes down to Sears and he buys an Elgin. Red and white with chrome fenders, and a battery and light. He pays $12.00 and it is delivered on Monday. He also invests in a Boy Scout uniform.
The week goes on and on Thursday he is called to the office. He is being 'replaced' by someone else. Mr. Zudock feels that he is not working fast enough. Shep is in a panic. He owes for the bike and has no job.
He gets home  that day and tells his mother what happened and the next day his father goes down to Sears and pays for the bike.
That was the beginning of an education. . .","This storyline was used for ""Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss""","According to Shep it was a Monday. (4-23-63 is Tues) Goldindex dated it as 4-23-62 which would be a Monday. There is no show for 4-22-63 so in my humble opinion this is more likely 4-22-63, misdated by a day, rather than a whole year.

Rinky Tink music with birds

200,000 people under the age of 25 have a terrible urge to make a movie or be in a play - to be applauded. Would you make a movie if they wouldn't let you put your name on it?

Are you starring in your life?

A man is lying on the beach with a chick with waves and wind in the background. She whispers ""Darling, Darling, let's... let's..."" and with eyes alight she says ""Darling, let's make a movie - a spectacular!"" People that do this really think it is an act of love.

A theme that is running through films is the emptiness of life. Neorealism. What was the old realism, Jimmy Stewart movies?

A misconception is that people of the past were happy because their lives were simple, and they had a kind of truth in their lives.

Shep notes that ""The mechanization that we have in our lives (all the means of communicating so quickly) has destroyed our sense of being ourselves. It is fascinating to think of 87 million people all being thrilled at the same time by Mary Martin at the same moment doing Peter Pan at the same instant over a great coaxial cable.""

Mandarin House commercial - will be delivered by Shep himself

Shep notes that dozens of kids tell him that their old man makes them go to bed early and they have to sneak the radio up. They say that he thinks the kids are wasting time if they are not watching TV.

The ""new vicariousness"" relates to being judged by how many hours are clocked in a waiting line to an art movie rather than how many books have been read in a week, as had previously been the gauge. 

Shep can't imagine that life is now more empty than 1000 years ago. He notes, however, that this emptiness was seldom recorded. ""You don't see all the people that were not inside Camelot (noted by Shep to be an isolated island).

We can't say that today's life is any more terrifying than life in any other time. Value judgements on death - ""It is not as bad to be killed by a mace as by a shell fragment, and not so bad to be killed by a shell fragment as by fallout."" He wonders if we know that more people were killed by night bombing in Cologne than by the atomic bomb.

Chinese restaurants in Chicago are called ""Chop Suey Joints.""
Shep tells about his Uncle Al and Aunt Kate and how they would order takeout. ""For you, ah amond cukie!"" Other Chicago treats included Hunkie and Pollack restaurants.","The date of the show was determined in four ways. First, it was on the reverse side of a reel to reel tape marked 4/23/62.
Second, there is an ad in the Long John Nebel show which immediately follows for the Hudson Vitamin catalog for April 1962. Third, Shep says that ""The White Sox beat the Yankees today!"" The New York Times for 4/25/62 states BOMBERS SUFFER THIRD LOSS IN A ROW! White Sox downed the Yankees 3-1. Fourth, the Long John Show following this show has guestwriters including Lester Delray, Caske Stinette, Bill Friedman, Frank Kane, Earl Conrad, etc. The New York Times for 4/24/62 lists Long John Nebel Show 12-5 Guests discuss ""The World of the Professional Writer""",

He sets out as a kid to buy a birthday gift for his father. He looks around in Woolworth's and almost buys a tie pin with a pheasant. He decides to ponder it for a while and heads for the toy department where he looks over the model airplanes. There was a big box marked ""Grab Bag 25 cents"". Considering this he decides to spend the quarter on one of the mysterious packages. After being asked by the cashier if he was sure he wanted it, he plops down the quarter and picks the biggest package there. He gets on the bus and get almost home. He gets off and goes to an empty lot where he can open it with nobody around. It turns out to be a Shirley Temple cutout book. He looks it over and heads back to Woolworth's. The woman behind the counter looks at him and asks if he wants his quarter back. He takes it and heads back out of the store and onto the bus. A lady on the bus asks his what's hanging on his elbow. When he looks he finds a blood red broach hanging on his sleeve. It must have hooked onto him while passing through the jewelry department. He takes it home and give it to his mother.

The only Chicago game in April 1963 - 04-24-1963 vs Chicago.  This is a Wednesday. 
Further evidence of 1963 - Shep says ""Mets win, Yankees lose"". (Yankees won 6-4,  Mets lost 2-0)
This happened in 1963, the reverse was true in 1964.  In 1963 (4/24), both the Yankees and Mets were playing the Chicago teams.  In 1964, the Mets were off on 4/22.

Shep sings ""Sitting On Top Of The World"".

Shep wishes that the astronauts were not such clean-cut looking people. He tells about a James Thurber short story "" The Greatest Man In The World"" (obviously inspired by Charles Lindbergh). The man makes a heroic airplane flight but it turns out that the man is a thug of the first order. He meets an untimely end in mysterious fashion. American can't have as a hero such an unworthy person.

Shep talks about how we want to refer to our notable people by first name or in other familiar terms, with reference to Gordon Cooper's military rank.

Shep talks about, when new in radio, he covered the Indianapolis 500 race.
 
He reported how the race really was progressing (dull) but he was told by his boss to make the race more interesting, to ""jazz it up"". Shep then does his version of coverage of a space shot. He satirizes the coverage and shows how ordinary events are exaggerated. Nothing in particular may be happening, but the reporter makes it sound like a dangerous, exciting and unusual situation. Just trying to make a dull story exciting.
Shep talks abut the ""Aha! Experience"". Shep is about six when he started school and was thrust into a new environment. He suddenly confronts new people who have different values and experiences.

Tells story about when he was a kid he had picture ""flip books"" that he traded with other kids. He had one of a baseball player hitting a home run. He traded it for another one.

It starts off with Shep reading a newspaper story, in his trademark bad Asian accent, about waiters in a restaurant somewhere in China beating a customer to death in a dispute over a check. The point is unclear.

He moves on to a newspaper story about teenage boys in Westfield NJ playing tennis in the dark with infrared glasses and a florescent tennis ball. This leads Shep onto the theme of the show: nocturnal games, particularly of the male teenage variety.

Shep taunts his listeners to state what they are dedicated to -- with the clear implication that it's probably a lot less than they imagine.

He reads a snippet of article about the celebrated Chicago bunko artist, Joseph ""Yellow Kid"" Weil, offering a Brass Figlagee to anyone who knows how he earned his nickname. He also makes reference to other Chicago folk-hero criminals, presumably by way of setting up the premise that Midwesterners are not as pure of heart as some may suppose. He uses that setup to launch into his story about nocturnal teenage games, laced with some Shepherdesque observations about the darker side of humanity.

Shep says he is about to make a confession, that at the ""yeasty age"" of 12 years old, one summer night he and about 15 of his Hammond pals (Swartz, Flick, Bruner, and a several other names appearing only rarely in his stories), spontaneously become a roving band of peeping toms, moving from house to house until, after four or five nights they ""taste the heady fruit of the clandestine"" by hitting the ""double jackpot."" He felt he had become a ""true rotten person,"" but of course did not stop -- until a police alert warning of band of peeping toms ran in the Hammond Times, and police cars appeared down the street one night about a week later.

Shep observes that he ""never met anyone who didn't have an affinity for sin of all kinds,"" and that human beings have the capacity for making it into an intellectual experiment, rather than admitting they do it for kicks. ""Mankind is great at hiding things,"" he concludes.","Shep seems to be distracted by some activity in the studio near the end of the show and wanders off-point, leading to not quite the big finish he might have intended.

This show contains a great description of hot, humid summer nights in the Midwest.",

Says that we all are Americans. Has a friend in Paris who paints. An art dealer saw his paintings and he said that he is painting Americans, that all of the people he paints look like Americans.

Talks about visit to Nigeria. It was so hot that you want to take off your skin. Life is all over the place. It is a very exciting place. Went to the post office in Nigeria to buy stamps. A guy in line reaches over and touches him. A huge handsome colored man. He is a guy from the States. He is glad to talk to an American. They get into the man's car and go for a drink. Turns out that the man is a listener from Brooklyn. He told Shep that ""I had to come all the way over here to discover that first and foremost I am an American.""

Went back to Lagos. In the hotel he is having a drink. Man asks S if he is enjoying trip. Man is from Poland. Guessed that he is a top flight Communist. Man came out with virulent racist talk about Nigeria. A man from one of the great People's Republics. 

The 4th of July is a truly American celebration. It is celebrating what you really are. It is not the 4th unless it is incredibly hot. Traffic jams and fireworks are part of the 4th. The 4th is a violent holiday. 

The Old Man ran a fireworks stand . A few week before the 4th he went out and got a supply of fireworks. Shep offers the brass figlagee to anyone who can identify various types of fireworks that he is describing. The scars of the fireworks would be all over town for at least two week after the 4th. Knows these things because fireworks was an integral part of his life as a kid.  Talks about OM, an absolute nut about of fireworks. Had a fireworks stand outside of the city limits of Chicago. Asks trivia questions about brands of fireworks. OM and S. set up stand and about midnight the business would peter out. OM was excite because he gets to shoot off the leftovers. S. liked fireworks but hated to work in the fireworks stand. Tells about hapless customers that needed their first aid supplies because the product they sold was too effective. Tells about wimpy rich kid ""Timothy"" who just wanted sparklers because he was afraid of the good stuff, but the kids father wants the big fireworks. S. visualizes their servant shooting off their fireworks.

S. said most traumatic experiences were about his father and fireworks. Tells about the ""Terrible episode of the backfiring roman candle"". Tells about various sizes of roman candles. The five dollar one was the biggest. Tells how OM set off the roman candle. The OM had style in everything he did: pool, bowling, etc. He put body English on the roman candle. Great moment in Ships life. OM liked roman candle best. Going fine when one ball shot backwards and right up his sleeve and out the back of his shirt. Shirt is on fire. OM was the best piece of fireworks of the whole night. He puts out the fire and in five minutes he is back  outside shooting fireworks. 

Tells story about of squibs (dud firecrackers) and how the neighborhood kids burned their faces when they set off the powder from about of five pounds of squibs. Powder from the squibs is put in a bucket and Flick drops in a match. All of their eyebrows are gone. 

Tells about fireworks on the great lakes, fireworks set off on ore boats. Tells about fireworks accident on the lake. The people liked it, it was a great display.

Final story about OM. Biggest 4th fiasco he ever saw. OM had about $350 of fireworks, at depression prices. Fill up two ton truck twice. Had the fireworks in two huge boxes. Put two boxes near big pinwheel.
Sparks are going into the boxes. Shep gives his usual vivid description of the ensuing disaster. Only regret anyone had was that the OM set them off all at once.

Shep begins by talking of summer madness and the gasoline price wars that Jersey had not long ago. This leads to him telling the story of the Great Ice Cream War between ""The Igloo"" and Borden's Dairy back in Hammond during the late 30's.
The two were right across the street from one another and one day a battle was fought driving the prices down from 12 cents a double dip to FREE.","This was originally thought to be the July 4th show, but has been redated due to the confirmed July 4th show surfacing.",

Talks about families. Says that there are different kinds of families.

Likes the idea that WOR bills itself as a family station. That American is ""hung"" on the term ""love"", it is a basic theme. Talks about cliches.

WOR is more like a Tennessee Williams family.

Suspects that what the slobs like today the avant-garde will not dig. Pool rooms are now billiards clubs, they have more classy spittoons. The avant-garde have just discovered the Western movie. The Village Voice was talking about a John Wayne movie. The Voice thought it was a new art form. The Hippies just discovered the Mets. They don't know that it is just bad baseball and not good against evil. Says his predictions came true. He said that the stag film will become an art form. That a movie house in the Village gave a whole night of stag films. They Just discovered it.

When he was a kid he remembers when in his neighborhood in the basement of the barbershop there was a ""Social and Smoker"". His mother would not let his father go to it. At 2 AM it was raided by the cops. Mr. Brunner was arrested too. Also Ray the barber was thrown in the jug. Now his father was cheering them on. Shep as a kid could not understand why people were arrested for watching movies, and why movies were in the basement of the barber shop. Brunner was finally seen sober after being released. The kids were curious and wanted to see the movie.

Shep says stag films are dull films, and now they are art. Wonders how far behind are the avant-garde. For years kids looked at comic books, and they admire pop art. Shep also talks about folk music. No ""folk"" would be welcome by the hippies.

Shep says that his father is a character in a James T Farrell novel. A character in a Studs Lonigan book. The author knew his father when they lived on the South side of Chicago. As a kid the Old Man was a pool shark and he never lost his skill.

The Old Man was an ace bowler. The family went bowling. The Old Man used to play pool at the alleys because he could not help himself at times.

Hot night in August, took family bowling in Chicago. In the back of the bowling ally were about 25 pool tables. As a kid he know nothing about that part of the alleys. The Old Man, Shep, kid brother, and Uncle Al went bowling. (Long digression about Mets and Sandy Koulfax , as a batter. Does not take them seriously).

They could hear clicking of pool balls in background of the alley noise. The Old Man kept looking at that part of the alleys. His father become a different person. Starts to play pool. His eyes became like tiny steel marbles. Plays with Uncle Al. The Old Man is bringing them into the game.

Starts to play pool with strangers. At 3 AM the Old Man gets into the house with three times his regular pay. Shep's Mother is shocked and bugged. Shep's father was not a gambler.",,"[Jim] Dating the show - Shep talks about a recent Met's game. He mentions Hunt's Home Run, Stallard vs Kofax, Kofax strikes out twice. Exception to what Shep said - Kofax struck out only once, not twice in an August 17th game where everything seems to match up. August 17th was a Saturday, but Shep was only on Mon-Fri in 1963.

He talks of a friend who is a ""turnpike person"" and their favorite color is Howard Johnson orange because it represents safety. This guy asks how people get across the road since there are no overpasses or underpasses. 

You see America in a whole different way. Never take a person from another country on the Turnpike to show him the countryside. At one time you would drive all through the countryside trying to find the turnpike and now you can't escape it. There are signs that lure you on in very subtle ways. The turnpikes are all built high - above the rubble of life. There's a certain guy who believes in the expressways as a way of life. Heaven is a giant Howard Johnson and Hell is an eternal detour on the outskirts of Providence on US Route 1.

Signs you see on the different highways. 

Driving in the dark through Ohio at 5 in the morning a Greyhound bus comes up behind him and scares him out of seven inches of growth barreling past.

Shep finishes with a story about how once a 57 Ford with equipped with a Continental customizing kit, and whip antenna, comes up to an S curve just ahead of Shep, drifts out and he drives right through the fence into oblivion. Shep pulls to the side of the road with 2 or 3 others and they get out to see when another plum color Buick comes around the bend and WHOOP! through the fence without touching the sides.

Observation from Ken Applegate:

I woke up in the middle of the night here and was mulling over what show Shep was talking about. Sure sounded like Dr. Stangelove, a pre-screening maybe, but so much of what happened that month is buried under a ton of Kennedy related stories after his assassination it is hard to figure!
 
I dug around the web and found: http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10D14F63B5E13778DDDA00A94D9415B838AF1D3
 
Shep's description (although limited), and his suggestion of what he would do if he were the Russians as a result, do seem to suggest that he had gone to a pre-screening of Dr. Stangelove, and the topic ""The Big Lie,"" was certainly used effectively by Kubrick in that movie! Most notably where Sellers needed money to call the Pentagon to stop a nuclear bomb attack, but was going to have to answer to the Coke-A Cola company for tampering with their machine to get that money! The release of the movie was another repercussion of the Kennedy assassination, as well as changes that were thought necessary to remove inadvertent links to that day in Dallas.
 
Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Strangelove) suggests an original official test screening date of November 22, which would suggest that unofficial test screenings among the Avant Gard were happening, and why Shep was so careful not to give away the name of the movie he had seen, which is in keeping with unofficial viewing disclosure agreements.

Shadows - Shep talks about a cartoon the Clown and how the artist's hand was seen drawing the image and the shadow followed him. The cartoon had an effect on Shep for a while about the shadows around him. He talks about the old radio show ""The Shadow"". 

The myth of the 'man who casts no shadow'. Is history the shadow behind us? Then there is the myth of the man who casts his shadow before him. Is that his future?

One Shep's favorite forms of writing is the Japanese Haiku because it has said more in less action and phraseology and because of the ancientness of it. Haiku is a 17th century classical form of Japanese poetry consisting of 17 syllables. They refer to time and seasons.

Says something is bugging him. Says a friend of his, a German girl, heard the show but did not understand why he was lauging. 

Plays a little of his nose flute and the Sheik of Araby. What is bugging Shep is that the theme of a soap opera is going through his head and he can't remember the name of the show.

He was in a meeting today. They wanted to put his show on in the morning after John Gambling. Talks about Advertising Age magazine. It is an important meeting, but the soap theme is in his head and Muzak is coming into the room. The meeting went nowhere, nothing happened in the meeting.

Present outward appearance that something is being accomplished. Hard to follow the thread of the meeting, it is easier to follow the thread of ""Waiting for Godot"". Says that Madison Ave ad executives are sexless like the rabbit or Mad Hatter in Alice in Wonderland. A lot of guys on Madison Ave have been defying gravity for years: no talent. In meeting could not get soap opera theme out of his mind.

Digresses to talk of old lady at Horn and Hardart who takes fifteen minutes to get ready to eat her small meal. Fusses with fork, napkin, etc. because she has nothing else to do.

Shep says he was enjoying the meeting. One half hour into the meeting he lost his concentration because of the soap theme. Talks about actors losing concentration. Plays the tune on the nose flute, talks to the engineer. Engineer does not know the tune either. Starts to see the people in the meeting as the characters in the soap opera. Plays and sings more of Sheik of Araby. Gives up trying to figure out soap theme. 

Says the rest of the show is brought to us as a public service of WOR, as compared to public service announcements that tell us to join the Marines. He says he is the only person who remembers America, that he can't forget anything. Says he remembers the theme of Lorenzo Jones.

Talks about how US soldiers in Pacific in WWII used trivia questions as passwords. The Japanese spoke English but did not know the things that an American would. ""Who sponsored Jack Armstrong?"" ""Wheaties"" 

Shep continues with Lorenzo Jones trivia, and asks engineer more soap opera trivia.

He says in newspaper he read about American ladies track team that is not doing well. Russian ladies work hard, are strong. US ""chicks"" want to do it the easy way. We want things instantly. Shep is a good American kid. 

We all cheat in one way or another but we agree not to notice each other's cheating. Ours is the only country that keeps up a high level of verbal smoke screen.

Shep is this kid. He thinks he is above normal disasters. Americans have a dream world: no disasters can touch us. Shep is in high school. He is on the track team. The #3 man on a 4 man team cross country running team. Flick is #4 on the team. Running needs endurance but no brains, just must be dogged. It is the first big track meet.  He has a tough coach, a real professional athlete. Coach tells them to eat nothing on the day of the meet. Shep has no breakfast or lunch. On the way to the stadium he and Flick stop at the Igloo. They eat a cheeseburger and a couple of shakes. They start the race very well. After about a mile Flick veers off into the bushes and is violently sick. Shep makes a lot of heaving sick sounds here. Next it is Shep who is sick. Now Shep makes ever louder heaving sick sounds.",,

The never show the guy at 4:00 in the morning driving around the block looking for a parking space in a 1958 Ford.
Life is difficult in New York. Just getting a note in your mailbox that there is a package for you at the post office. This means you have to take two weeks off having to find the post office and then being turned away because you don't have the right identification.

Shep talks about inflatable girls. Are there going to be inflatable men? He tells about how he predicted this back in his early days during one of his all night shows.

Shep tells the story of how he go to go to Scout Camp when he was 12. There was a contest in scouts during the annual jamboree. The three scouts that tied the best knot, built the best canoe, etc. would get to go. Shep displayed his two tube receiver that he had build and it was a hit, so he was selected to go. The list of stuff he needs to take with him comes in the mail and the family goes into hock getting this stuff together. Waterproof match box, Ax, mattress ticks, duffle bag, and more.

Going seems like fun, but actually getting on the bus to leave is a deteriorating experience. ""I'm about to go to camp with everybody who hit me!"" It seems like everybody knows each other and he's the only stranger.

I have decided that from here-on in, in my life, I am going to build a giant edifice. I am going to work with the blocks of time... of course you have to look at that symbolically. Time in this case being the raw clay of existence and I will pat each small hour, each tiny minute, each fleeting second into a thing of beauty. I will pat it together with the hands, see - and then I'll put the next second on top... of course these things often have a way of going awry.""

Hand grenades - throwing them in the army and their use in Chicago to help collect ""insurance"" against their use on a business. Mr. Schwartz of Schwartz's cleaners misses a payment and ends up owning a hole in the ground.

A London Times article on studies of animal aggression inspire Shep to discuss this topic.

""Animals from the hippopotamus to the ant have for various reasons aggressive traits. But the species which shows up worst in biological research on animal aggression is Homo Sapiens. Only in man is aggression so uncontrolled as to lead to wholesale killing within a species.""

""As the animal goes higher up the scale in intelligence, he becomes more aggressive for his own sake.""

""Non-human animals seldom kill one another under normal conditions in the wild. Fighting is ritualized.""

Ritualized fighting according to strict rules... Like a boxing match... Aggression as a means of establishing social rank...

Why would we kill one another, whereas the other animals don't.
We share with the animal kingdom - primal fear.

The ideal would probably be to copy those species which have ritualized aggression to the point of making threats without coming to blows.

Judge Landis, on hand to watch the game, offers a $5,000 reward over the PA system for the culprit, but only draws more boos. The deluge of pop bottles finally abates when Jimmy Dykes pleads through the field amplifier. The Yanks sweep a pair from the Sox, winning 12-3 and 11-8 in 11 innings. Lou Gehrig hits his 29th with two aboard to start New York's scoring in the opener. DiMaggio and Lazzeri add round trippers to make it easy for Johnny Broaca. Sugar Cain is the losing pitcher. In the nitecap, Gehrig adds another homer, while Zeke Bonura homers and drives home four runs for the Sox. DiMaggio has one hit, a triple. The sweep increases New York's lead to nine 1/2 games.",

Social changes first manifest in the peoples rituals. When someone picks out a Christmas card, they are saying something very important about their tribe, world. Modern cards are very different than 1900's cards.

Santa Clauses in 1900 were very European. Looked Germanic or Nordic.

Figures hardly anyone is listening, so it is OK to do this type show. Advises listeners to stop listening and go out and look at the sky, or take a walk. 

Last few years cards had a guarded quality to cover up emotion about other people. They were often hip/beat oriented.

1964 is post-JFK and now Christmas cards are no longer hip/Jules Feiffer/beat style. 1964 Christmas cards are secular religious. Natural romantic/Rousseau or trees or ski slopes or lakes or red cards with a bit of gold. They are transcendental or honoring nature not man. Oriented toward selfishness. It has become a statement of taste.

Cites a growing trend to not send any so that they don't make any statement that can be used against you.

The reason a particular card is selected is far deeper than willing to admit or knows. More than colors or style of Santa Claus. Why do preferences change? 

Sometimes self-proclaimed atheists send out the most religious cards. 

Tells story about an 11 year old he met. Why do kids relate to criminals as hero? Underdogs are the heroes in literature. Legitimate underdogs are pursued by police and criminals are pursued by police. Police only pursue underdogs. Under dogs are good therefore those pursued by police are good.

Many youth feel life is composed of an infinity of troubles, i.e., inequality, repression, badness and evil perpetrated by others. They are victims. The kid feels that the most fortunate person is the person who has no trouble at all. They are somebody who is dead.

Representative of many kids who have a secret death wish, which is related to drug use. It is an obliteration of consciousness. If you can retain the old words like consciousness, beauty and truth and apply them to the obliteration of those things, you have achieved the cake and eating it that everyone wants. So a man will obliterate his life with drugs and will call it ""expanding his consciousness"". He uses old phrases to cover up a new way to get stoned.

Shepherd agrees with the kid that there seems to be no remedy, no escape from troubles. We have tried political, economic philosophies, revolution upon revolution to no solution. Kid has restated theme religious folks have had for years that the only place there is no trouble is heaven where he stops being a part of the world.

Now, this feeling of sad disaffection is shared by religious people and atheists.

The pecking order of animals. Put a group of chickens together and within 5 minutes there is a head hen and a number two hed and so on down the order.

Does Charlie the dog really know what a car is, does he know the scenery is moving past him. Is he aware the vehicle is moving?

Does a horse have a concept of winning? Does the cat show independence because it is so smart or because it is dumb? 

We are the only animals that get hung up on other animals. Have you ever run across a chipmunk that has a turtle as a pet.

One thing that man shares with other animals is protectice coloration. He assumes the color of the atmosphere he lives in. Like a chameleon. Shep decribes having chameleons as pets when he was a kid, pinning them on the curtains and scaring girls. Man changes his 'color' to adapt the the surroundings.

Using pet names, smoothing your way with magic words, being utterly helpless, sloppy natural emotions, are all examples of protective coloration.",,

He never mentions the Playboy mansion by name. His mission this show, is to tell New Yorkers what Chicago and other cities are like. 

Throughout the show Shep takes the typical provincial view and calls New York City ""New York"" and city dwellers ,""New Yorkers.""

NY is the last bastion of Victorianism, but Chicago is Babylon revisited.

Chicago is hip, NY is Squaresville. Sybaritic life is so rampant in Chicago that everything in NY looks like a Girl Scout troop.

In Chicago, Musak has taken over everything, even funeral parlors.

The Playboy lifestyle is actually available in Chicago. In Chicago, the good life and bad life never mix. Fist fights and bums are found everywhere in NY but Chicago has a coral for that.

Chicago has much less traffic and people are not crammed together. Compares Chicago weekday traffic to NY Sunday traffic.

Chicago is casual. In Chicago, he lived in a house, implying the Playboy Mansion, where no one used last names. Says last names will vanish, because names are controversial and say something about your background.

During the commercials, he runs a tangent and says if he had all the money he spent on cars, he would own WOR and fire all the Klutzes at WOR.

NY is incredibly filthy, dirty. Suspects it is one of the dirtiest cities in the world. Chicago thinks it is a dirty city but it is relatively clean. 

NY is noisier than an oriental bazaar.

NY has a certain sense of excitement, but other cities have a sense of architectural style that makes NY relatively ugly. He bemoans New York's ugly architecture to some length.

New Yorkers have lost the virtue of civic anger, and are tolerant of annoyance.

Banging in a grill while parking is completely accepted.

Radio, television is different in Chicago. NY doesn't have live, personal ads.

In Chicago, commercials are watched as a form of entertainment, including fan clubs.

Chicago television seems more alive, NY television is kind of dead.

New York Worlds Fair is lifeless, built to be there. Maybe NY is dead and maybe what America will be is happening outside of NY.

Says he never told the story on the air about the time he blew up like a Christmas Turkey.

When he was 10 years old he went to an Ukranian-American winter barbecue. Schwartz, Flick, Bruner and him get on the line for burgers, rush off and eat them and keep returning. They did this until 9:30 at night and after each consuming 17 burgers, piles of chips, and bottles of Nehi orange they go home. As he lay there in bed that night, he begins to feel himself swell - beginning to bulg out all over. And then the pain came and he began to swell some more.

Plays a tape of some fantastic Jews harp music from India. He is completely outclassed.  Feigns to be ""broken"".  

There was another time he was completely crushed in the world of music.

Some people do not compete, but others are the ones that  know ecstatic delight and crushing defeat.

This story is of a traumatic defeat.

Describes the hell of a tuba player such as when folks throw things into the bell.  This creates a sadness in all tuba players.

Discusses his sense of sickening defeat.  In high school he feared being compared to others and this manifested itself in the form of a terrifying, but required public speaking course with Miss Parsons.  

Even seeing the public speaking classroom with the stage and lectern made him feel sick and queasy.  On the first day he is supposed to do a one minute speech on what he wants to be when he grows up.  He shrivels up inside. All's he can think of is he will ride on the bus and eat sandwiches, stand on the street corner, eat cheeseburgers and scratch.  But Eileen Ackers got up and did very well describing being an artist.  He gets up and his mind has left his body and he has no idea what he said.  The rest of the semester was worse.  

Back to the story he is the ""ace of the base"" with his tuba.  He is one with the tuba and loves it.  Then he is cajoled into competing in the Indiana state solo competition.  He actually gets all psyched up to do it. 
 
But he gets blown out of the water by a kid he derisively called ""little jug ears"".  He felt sick and did not remember anything he played and at the end he got a distant 2nd place.

From this he learned that no matter how good you are at something, there is someone else out there that can do it much better.  You can always be upstaged.

He closes with a Happiness commercial running over the theme song.

There are Japanese soft drinks. Small motor scooters with ricshaw backs have replaced the traditional old ricshaws.

They go to a small restaurant where the Thai people go to eat American food, but they order Thai food. They order soup - not so hot, and beef. The food arrives and is beautifully prepared. The first taste of the soup turns his friend's face a cold ice blue. Shep tastes it and it is the single most hot soup he ever had. The other food while hot was nothing after the soup.

He talks about the river water, while not polluted, it is filled with parasites and diseases. The pilot of the small plane is delivering a battery to one of the missionaries in the jungle.

The sand fly, the vampire bat, and other dangers that the people must endure there. The bat atacks the chickens they keep for food.

The birds of the jungle. ""The smaller the bird the bigger the sound""

Shep explains how he recorded much of the trip on tape.

He talks about how you become chief of the tribe by 'braining' all the competition. The camp is difficult to navigate into so it makes it harder for the enemy tribes to enter. They always are on the alert for jaguar and enemy tribes coming into thecamp.

The violin is handmade and has a face carved into it. They explained that the face meant ""it sings to you"". Shep plays an excerpt of Arushba playing the 2 string instrument.

The Shapra had no written language. The missionaries are trying to provide them with the written language so that they can preserve their history and not disappear.

He talks about the interpreter and how she and another girl, just out of college, went to meet this tribe and interpret their language. It took 8 years and she was eventually made a 'sister' of the tribe.

He decribes eating monkey which is one of the main foods they consume.

He plugs his story in Playboy, but misquotes the title as ""Red Ryder Nails the Hammond Kid or Justice Gets the Evil Doer"" (Correct title was - ""Red Ryder Nails the Hammond Kid"")

Most people don't know what winter is about. ""Have you ever looked back on your life and thought about a fantastic, unbelievable senseless trek or hang-up that you have had that you can not explain at this moment... something that you wanted so tremendously or some insane thing that you decided to do and you carry through in spite of the fact that the car sank in forty feet of water, that you had to swim fourteen miles in raging seas?""

As a kid, Shep finds a flyer in the mail from the local IGA. They advertise a bushel of apples for 45 cents and Shep decides to surprise his mother with a bushel of apples. In the midst of a snowstorm he rounds up his brother, Bruner, and Flick and off they trek with their sleds through the howling wind and snow. They arrive frozen in front of the IGA and it is closed. Shep decides to struggle on to the A&P which had stayed open a half hour later. When faced by four frozen kids holding the flyer for apples, the manager goes to the basement and brings back a bushel of apples. Feeling sorry for the boys, who had made the trek through the storm with their sleds, he arranged for them to be driven home in the back of the A&P truck. They come up on the back porch with a bushel of frozen apples. ""Have you ever tasted an apple that was frozen and then thawed out? The instant those apples thawed out, they all turned into one gigantic pile of brown mush!""

In 8th grade, the teacher (Miss Fife, ""a little dark haired teacher with rimless glasses"") decided to relax and read a short story to the class. She had one in her purse which was written by Jack London. It was about a man and his dog struggling in the frozen North trying to stay alive. Shep calls this story ""The Two Matches"" (See notes below) He had only two matches between survival and and freezing to death. The class became so caught up in the story that near the end, when the bell rang signaling the end of class, they were all left wanting more. The teacher closed the book and told the class that if they were interested in the end of the story, they could find a copy a the library. 37 kids that day were turned on to reading.","The actual story appears to be ""To Build a Fire"" written in 1908.

The British are a chauvinistic society, second only to the French. He describes the social classes, and compares the upper class urban life to a half-baked Manhattan underground/underworld life.

He would introduce a man on the street show and while the theme music was playing, run down to the street, do the interviews and then run back up to the studio to do another show such as ""Bing Sings"", as a different personality. Then he would put a long record on and run to the local hardware store and pitch for them to buy commercial time, getting back to the studio just in time for the end of the record.

They were barreling along, three hillbillies and Shep in a Pontiac station wagon.  Then they turn onto an unmarked gravel road.

They go around a pond into an empty field with about 75 cars from many states. They go into a barn.  In the barn is an amazing little horseshoe grandstand with a sunken pit lined with green cloth.

""Dynamic begging"" is the most virulent form of love.  National symbol should be a loveable cocker spaniel.  It says ""Please love me"". The theme of eternal love is in all our art forms such as songs and plays.

Only U.S. could have invented ""Dear Abby"", a love confessionalist, or Edgar A. Guest.

Peace is just a schtick.  Americans like war and violence too. Love and war:  The Peace Mace represents the best of all possible worlds.

America is the country of prepackaged messages of love (Valentine's cards), for those who are primarily illiterate.  Actually some people save Valentine's cards, even from people they hate. This gets Shep on a British theme that lasts the rest of the show.

He uses the Beatles an example of British slobism. British actors get a pass in America just because they are British, taking over American theater.  It is so bad it affects the economics of theatre.  Seems to be a real sore point.

As usual, he uses commercials to go off topic a bit. Talks about the Luden head hunter religion that was created by Shepherd when Shep handed out Luden T shirts with a big red ""L"" to a tribe in the upper Amazon. Evelyn Wood demos are a great show and good for a cheap date. Actually improves on the commercial this time. A good example of Shepherdian hyperbole: Rovers are so durable that there are still some around from before cars were invented.

Americans can love any country but ourselves.  Same way with our own search for identity in novels and plays. On the whole, America is not nearly as chauvinistic compared to English or France or Australians.

Cites foreigners coming to America, and criticizing America on radio interviews.  We are the world's patsy because we take all the criticism. 


Tells of a NY actor who knocked around for 9 years with nothing, who went to England, changed his name and came back as a successful actor.

English secretaries are being hired by the boatload too, for their accents.  This is because we have a cultural feeling of inferiority.

Even college kids at Harvard, Yale try to pick up an accent.  Harvard accent is pseudo-British.

The British mechanic visits America and travels all over, for months and wrote major English newspaper articles about how great it is for the average working guy here, which caused a great national controversy.

It was pointed out that most of the people that come to America to be critics of America are from privileged classes.  They want first class.

Privileged classes of Britain do not like real democracy.  They don't like to wait in line and expect to be treated according to their ""station"". For example there is no 1st, 2nd class travel on trains.

Western Union has 38 love messages( e.g. ""I'm in Reno.  Expect to hear from my lawyer.  Be my Valentine."" There are lots of ways to express love.

This is interrupted on occasion by a mysterious thumping sound in the studio. Shep calls for an investigation using a scope and caller feedback.

Discussion of leading a sheltered life and going to the city dumps to rummage for treasures. He asks if there was anyone else out there who did this secretly without their families knowledge, and in a RARE moment he actually takes a phone call and the caller is heard on the air. The caller had been to the dumps just 3 weeks previous.

The main story unfolds about the time he and another kid from school named Dopler went on a bike ride one afternoon and visited the city dump. Dopler had been there before, but it was Shep's first time and he was in awe of the things he saw. He talks of families that live there,  the rats, and a man with a derby who watched the dump and lived in a shack made up of old Coke and Pepsi signs. It sported license plates and toilet seats for décor. Living with the old man, who sold worms and dough balls for bait on the side, was a huge black crow that had a vocabulary better than many humans. The boys visited often and sat with the old man and the crow on the bank of the river that ran through the property. Eventually they stopped going and Dopler moved away never to be seen again, but the visits to the dumps remain a fond memory in Shep's mind even today as he recounts the story.",This is one of those rare times that Shep spoke to a caller on the air and one of the fewer times that you heard both sides of the story.,

After the theme, Shep breaks right into song by singing (?) the new official state song of New Jersey.  

In a New York Times front page article, Cornell University has concluded a seven year study and gave low ratings to American bathrooms.

In other studies, new ailments breaking out include back problems from watching too many re-runs, eye problems from watching the second Late Late Movie, and aching pains just over the left buttocks from carrying a wallet thick from credit cards. ""Credit-card-itis""

The 'painful' discussion continues as Shep talks about the Yankees and what he feels are the effects of tight underwear. He tells about when he was playing ball as a kid and got hit in the head with a pitch. Not only was he called out, but he suffered a ringing in the head for six weeks. Once, his batting average had slipped 70 points and the coach tells him that his problem was tight underwear. So he goes out and buys 3 new pair of jockey shorts and his batting average goes up 40 points in a week.

He couldn't even go to the movies because it disturbed people all around.
Another ailment Shep had was in infection in the middle ear that made him think E. Power Biggs, the famous organist, was playing Bach right next door, humming and tapping his feet at the same time.

He tells the story of a doctor friend who couldn't get a date until he graduated Med school and had Doctor in front of his name. He picks up his girl and they go to a restaurant together to eat and dance. After being seated for a while she tells him that his zipper is open. He trys to zip it up without anyone at the other tables seeing him do it, so he pulls his chair close to the table and zips it.

After a short while they decide to get up and dance. As he stands the table cloth is stuck in his zipper and he pulls everything off the table. Shep relates this to a similar instance when he was playing in ""Banquet for the Moon"" and had his fly open on stage.

Everyone cheered.

After the news break Shep reads a NY Times article about a 10 year old boy who pours gas on the back of his trousers to take off like a rocket. ""A great moment in kiddom!""

Shep goes 'scragging' with Lawrence Striker. They need gas and wait until dark to siphon some out of the Anderson's car. Shep sucks down the gas, the Anderson's dog comes out barking and Mr Anderson catches him.

Outside a sheep stands in the middle of the street, and a burrow comes around the corner with a girl riding carrying peppers.

Shep tells about his experience with a camel. New people move into the 'haunted house' on the block and they have a camel in the garage. Shep starts feeding it the leftover peanut butter and jelly sandwiches he had for lunch every day. After several months, one day he eats his whole sandwich and comes by empty handed. The camel is not amused and takes a big bite out of his new sheepskin coat. Shep's mother accuses him of lying when he tells her how the camel bit his coat, so he blames it on Flick. She sticks a bar of soap in Shep's mouth and calls Flick's mother. (See notes) He also tells of  the sea lion they also had in the garage, living in a tank with cigar butts and beer cans. They would tap on the window and the sea lion would surface, its sad eyes peering at them. They would feed it apple cores every day after school. Then one day while they were playing ball a truck pulls up. The men go into the garage an come out carrying the sea lion on a stretcher. It had died.","Soap in mouth:
This basic concept was used in A Christmas Story. In stead of getting the soap in the mouth for lying, it was because of the cursing. The phone call is made to Schwartz's mother instead of Flick's.

The camel story was also told during the 1-6-71 show, ""The Camel and the Coat""",This is the same show as the one dated 1963 The Negev Desert which was incorrect since Limelight shows did not start until 1964

He then sets up the theme of the show by reading an article about a group of collage students in London that show up at a housing project one day claiming that they are filming a commercial for beans. They gather up about 74 of the local residents and get them marching around the recreation grounds yelling ""BEANS, BEANS, BEANS"" for forty-five minutes. Then they pack up and leave. There never was a commercial - the people had been HAD.

This leads Shep to tell three stories about practical jokes in radio. 

1) While working at a station in Cincinnati, the station invites listeners to apply for taking part in a talk about a product and their experiences with it. They choose 45-50 pompous old ladies from the applicants and bring them into a room at the studio. Here they are invited to talk all about ""Hot Digity Dog"" with secret ingredient ""Zowie 7"". This of course is a fictitious product, but they all sit around and talk about how swell it is for 45 minutes. 

2) Also while working in Cincinnati, Shep is the emcee for ""Preview Star Time"" an all new coast to coast radio show, which of course was not real. Shep warms up the audience until it's ""airtime"" and then everything 'goes wrong'. Shep starts off with a really dirty joke stunning the audience, then a totally drunk singer comes out to sing ""Danny Boy"", and finally the band breaks out in a fight. At this point the NBC executive stops the show, yelling at everyone, and sends the unsuspecting audience out into the street. The phony show was never intended to go on the air.

3) The last story is about a seasoned newscaster who takes his work seriously. When he's on the air, no one is allowed in the studio with him. One night while he's on, Eddie the salesman walks into the studio smacks him on the back, and says ""Hey you old son of a gun, you still giving them that old jazz?"" and walks out saying ""Give 'em hell Charlie."" Shaken by this he tries to get back on track with the news when the door opens again and in walks an engineer carrying a soldering iron looking around. ""Hey, are you on the air?"" he asks and walks out. Now clearly in shock the newscaster barely gets the show done. It wasn't until the next day that he learned that the entire broadcast was never heard over the air because it was pre-empted at the last minute by another special broadcast. It was only enjoyed by the people working in the studio.",,

Shep says he'll get blamed for reporting the article. The reporter is always blamed for the event.

This leads to a discussion of Fantasy vs. Reality. How drug addicts substitute drugs for life, animal lovers substitute the love of their animal for real love.

He says this is a theme that runs through his work - the constant battle between reality and a dream. 

WWII was about a nation who believed they were the supreme creation of mankind. 
Anything you do, give it enough publicity and it will go.

Real life is a fantasy to some people.  The more you spend the better it is. Fantasy with people is if it is free, it's no good.

A discussion about movies based on reality and those based on fantasy.

Why people elect the 'aristocracy' - does it take smartness to get rich or just shrewdness. Look up the meanings of Wisdom and Shrewd. Shrewd leads to wealth, wisdom does not.","(Leave it to the Brits) (Shadow style open - Leigh is Margo Lane. ""Whoopee Does Not Pay!"")

As they reach the reviewing stand they all peel off, leaving the last row of 8 tuba players headed by Snuffy Smith. Snuffy stumbles over a bench and falls. The other seven tuba players commence to fall on top of him. Stinky, seeing this, blows his whistle and instantly the band starts playing El Capitan.

While playing in Class D mior league baseball Shep was struggling with his average. After striking out on a pitch down the middle with a man on second in a tie game, the manager yells out of the dugout ""You know what your problem is? Tight underwear!"" He tells Shep to buy 3 pair of underwear 4 sizes too big. In the following month Shep's average gained 43 points.

At age 13 Shep, Casmir, Esther Jane, and Helen Weathers all go to the amusement park and ride the 'bob', the giant roller coaster. Shep describes how stuff was pulled out of him by centrifugal force, hanging there in midair. It was squirting out of his ears. One old hamburger got caught in his ear. They took 4 rides and after it was all done Casmir had trouble speaking and Shep had forgotten how to spell.

As Corporal T-5 and stationed in Ft Monmouth, Shep and Gasser stand inspection before a weekend pass. Shep decribes having a footlocker with everything glued in place just for inspections. Sgt Kowolski and Lt Cherry make their rounds and after passing inspection and having Lt Cherry comment on how well Shep and Gasser looked, the last thing they see as Kowalski leaves the tent is his hand, flipping a well known salute.

They get their pass and go to Asbury park where they begin following these two girls. Shep and Gasser follow them into a seafood restaurant and the boys eat two rounds of Cherrystone Clams and Lobster followed by dessert and a brandy. It was the first time Shep ate clams. ""If you listen carefully to a bowl of clams you can hear them moaning"". Next they follow the girls to an amusement park and manage to get onto the same ride with them. (Dive Bomber) They sit opposite the girls and after the ride starts, Gasser turns green, and they both loose their lunch. As the clams come out, 'yelling yay!' Shep yells across to the girls - ""Duck!"" Everything he ever ate including pablum came out. Finally they had finished when suddenly one of the girls yells ""Duck!"". As the ride comes to a halt, the attendant looks in at them and says ""Looks like your having fun in there, this one's on me!"" and around they go again.","The ""Tight Underwear"" story was first told on his 5-2-59 WOR show and again on the 5-9-66 show.

The tongue myth stated that if, on a very cold day, you placed your tongue on a metal object, it would stick forever. So one day on the way to school Shep, Flick, Schwartz, and Bruner start talking about this and as they pass an iron telephone pole, start to dare one another to try it. Dares led to double dares and then to the double dog dare! Flick walks up and places his tongue right on the pole and it's stuck!! The rest of the kid's run to class leaving Flick behind.

Shep sets the topic of the show by mentioning that is the heart of cantaloupe season in the Midwest.

He, Flick, Schwartz and Bruner go out to the river on their bikes and come across a cantaloupe patch. After a discussion about stealing one, they decide it is too light out and they should come back after dark, Even though they all had cantaloupes in their refrigerators back home, they felt the need to steal one. They go back home, eat supper and hang out until it gets dark. Then Shep, Flick and Schwartz hop on their bikes and return to the field just out of view of the farmer's house. Accompanied by owls, mice, muskrats, black snakes and all the other creatures that come out at night, they sit there cutting open cantaloupes and eating. After eating their fill they decide to take some home and just as they were about to leave a dog starts barking. A door slams in the distance and the farmer is silhouetted in the moonlight at the top of the hill. ""Who's down there? Who's down there in that field?"" The shot gut goes off and there is the sound of bees going past the boys ears. Flick gets nicked with one of the pellets. They take off and don't stop until they come to the gas station where they all run into the men's room and unleash all the cantaloupes they had eaten. ""Crime does not pay!""","Shep yells at Leigh.

Merry old England - An 18# ham blows out of a pressure cooker.

This is an early version of the story of the Bumpus Family story that appeared in the April 1969 Issue of Playboy, as a chapter in the book ""Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories…"" and the movies ""A Christmas Story"" and ""My Summer Story"".
As with many of Shep's stories there was a constant evolution of the story from the first time it was told on the radio to the time it was put on film.

Emil Bumpus rips the back porch off the back of the house after arguing with someone inside. This was used in ""My Summer Story"" only it was in response to the old man's threat to call the cops. Not certain if it was Emil or another Bumpus.

The target in this story was a ham instead of the Christmas turkey and it was for no particular holiday.

The dogs drag the ham out into the back yard, they don't eat it in the kitchen.

Old man Bumpus see this and starts to laugh, the old man throws a beer bottle at the side of the Bumpus house. 

After returning to the house and surveying the mess, he tells everyone to get dressed, we're going to the Chinese joint. (This is same as ""A Christmas Story"")

Shep tells of his first love, Dawn Strickland, at the age of five. He was madly in love with her even though he didn't understand the meaning of love and would visit her every day since she lived across the street. They went to school together at William McKinley elementary. He mentions Schwartz, Ester Jane Alberry and Jack Morton being in the same class. They lived in an apartment house and Dawn lived across the street in a house with a playhouse in the backyard. The one day about two weeks before Christmas, the old man comes home with the news that he got a promotion and were moving to the country. Three days later the moving van pulled away and he never saw Dawn again.

While in the Army he reads a story in the Hammond paper that Dawn marries a Baron who is a Brigadier General.

This leads to the Army story about the time he was serving chow on the mess line out in the field. While serving a guy comes from behind and holds out his plate. Without looking, Shep tells him ""Get in line bud!"" Turns out he said this to a Brigadier General who later sends word down to Shep that he did the right thing.","He claims he never saw Dawn again. He also Flick and Schwartz being in McKinley with him - did they move also? The move may be based on his move from Chicago to Hammond at an early age but the characters, except Dawn, are all Hammond related. Another example of how Shep would weave truth and fiction into his stories. [Jim Clavin]

19700328W,"March 28, 1970",Overseas Press Club Conference,,re-cap,,Radio,WOR Show,,,,"There were two ""Press Club Conferences held.

The first was on March 2, 1970
Shep mentions that there are 600 people representing 300 schools attending.
An edited down tape of the conference was played on WOR in place of one of Shep's Saturday night shows a few weeks later. Shep did the intro for it.

The second was April 8, 1971. There may have been at least one more. In the 1971 audio he mentions doing it again. 

According to Ken Scharf, who attended and recorded the 1971 event: ""Actually I think there were a few press conventions BEFORE 1970, but they were done at WOR's studio.  When the event outgrew that location they moved it to the overseas press club location.""


Some of the questions:

1) ""Do tapes of your show exist?"" Shep claims to tape every show and they are reviewed later. The one's which are felt to be not important are erased. 

He knows of a kid in Texas who maintains a lending library of all the shows. Gets them from an associate in Brooklyn who tapes them.

2) ""What do you think of transparent blouses?"" He can't wait for transparent mini-skirts!

3) ""Why are you referred to as Ralph in the book IGWT?"" Shep explains that Ralph is not him. Just a character telling the story in the 'first person'.

4) ""Could you explain the origin of 'Flick Lives'?"" Shep says ""If you have to ask, you'll never understand.

5) ""Will you give another show at Town Hall?""  Tried for this past New Year's but it was already booked. Trying for a show in the fall.

6) ""Why did you stop performing at the Limelight?"" Since most of  the college dates needed to be a Saturday or Sunday, he preferred to do them since 
he enjoyed the college shows more.

7) ""You one said 1970 was going to be the year of the ego - explain."" People are beginning to have total ego. Every 15 year old kid feels that he's 
qualified to solve the political problems in the Middle East. Rock singers will be advising the Treasury Dept.

8) ""How long have you been at WOR?"" In its present form since 1958.

9) ""What started you on a show business career?"" Played H.S. football - defensive back. In Sophmore year a faculty advisor connected with the local 
radio station asked his to comment on the week's game on a sports show.

10) ""What do you think of Rex Reed - Rachel Welch?"" Being male there is only one thing to think about Rachel Welch.

11) ""Is Zinsmeister and the Treacherous - closer to life than you'll admit?"" All my stories are as close to life as I can get. All my stories are based on fact, 
but quite often I make it into a form larger than life.

12) ""Are you aware of the large cult following which holds you in God like awe?"" - ""You're damn right I'm aware of it! And one day I'm going to send down a lightning bolt and destroy them all!  -  Gang, let's rise up now and go down and burn down City Hall!""

13) ""What changes do you foresee in broadcasting in the future?""  Since 1965 or 66 radio has become the medium of the kids - By 1975 there could be a 100 Shepherds on the air doing anything other than playing records or giving the time.

14) ""How do you feel about the drug problem?"" Shep explains he lost 3 friends to drugs. One was the director of the psychadelic sequences in the movie 
""The Trip"" He continues to give a serious lecture about how drugs are bad and to avoid their use.

15) ""Why don't you come out to Nassau County?"" -  ""I haven't been invited"" Says last week he did a show at NCE and one at Oneonta. (The state 
University of New York at Oneonta.

16) ""Are the stories you tell on the air ficticious or true?"" - Yes - They are true stories but you bring out the points you want people to see. It's not 
literally true, but it is true in spirit. Flick, Schwartz and Bruner really exist.

17) ""Would you like to be a leader of your country?"" Anybody in the entertainment industry is a leader because you can influence people.

18) ""If you had a chance to do a top television show, would you quit radio to do it? ' Jus","The OPC conf was recorded on Monday March 2, 1970.","Dating notes:

He compares man to other animals and their adaptability to their environment. He tells how the Koala Bear is not adaptable, it survives on eucalyptis trees only wheras man can adapt to different foods as others become hard to find. The cockroach, a subject Shep dicusses quite often, is very adaptable. They can survive on wood, leather, leaves, and even cigar butts.

Some creatures are more fertile than others, multiplying at significant rates. The elephant barely reproduces to maintain its existence, where the cockroach multiplys at an incredible rate. 

Man, like rats, become extremely paranoid when living in close quarters. Shep predicts that by the end of the century there will be an exodous out of the big cities. Man is a nest fowler. He fowls his nest and then moves on to another one. People will be moving to the vast open spaces out West.

By the end of the 21st century Shep believes that there will be more communities living on the waterways in river houseboats, or in the middle of Lake Superior in large cities.",So far only the last 20 minutes of this show has surfaced.,

One comes from a woman who feels that he keeps flying his plane over her house and even goes so far as to hire someone to do it while he is away.

Shep tells about the man crawling around on his hands and knees on the sidewalk. Shep stops and asks him what the problem was. He lost his keys. 

This reminds Shep of the time he had been working at a local garage, grinding valves, working on cars for $1.40 an hour. He tells about the time one Saturday when he had the itch to do something with his old man's car. He goes out and sits in it, then decides to turn it around. Finally he opens the hood and decides to clean the carburator. 

After struggling to get the 4 bolts loosened he removes it from the car, then he removes and cleans the gasket. After cleaning out the carburator, he puts in back on the car. Each bolt goes on tighly and after strugglingwith the 3rd one he reaches for the 4th and it's gone! He gets down on his hands and knees and searches everywhere. In a panic he closes the hood, puts the tools away, and heads off for the park to play baseball. 

When he gets back he finds the old man going crazy trying to start the car. Shep tells him there is gas under the car. They open the hood and the old man discovers not only the missing bolt, but the other 3 are stripped and the carburator is loose. Since Shep had just returned from playing baseball the old man assumed it was Randy and he got the blame.

In Milano, Italy parents storm a school to regain control after students take over.

Letter from kid who purchased a 1936 Hudson - Shep relates ""the facts of life"" learned from his own Hudson Hornet (""an aggressive piece of junk"") purchased from Friendly Fred 

Story of Old Man's Essex which couldn't get off the street car tracks due to bad kingpins as street car approaches

Adaptability of cockroaches and man - both can be frozen in a block of ice and survive when thawed

Story of radio station promotion at a circus in which Shep (age 17) is frozen in a block of ice while providing five minute remote broadcasts every three hours to describe the process - complete with a feeding tube, rubber suit, attached microphone, and refrigeration tank   ","This show was edited down from a 55 minute Saturday night show originally aired on March 15, 1969.
Opening theme - The 12/9/70 show starts with a new theme. On the 3/15/69 show he talks over the theme and mentions it being Saturday. Towards the end of the theme the 3/15/69 show is cleverly edited in for the theme's finish just as Shep starts singing ""La Cha...Cha Cha...""

Both shows run parallel through the bit about the Milano Italy Schools and at the point right after Shep sings happy birthday, the 12/9/70 show skips ahead about 5 minutes to where Shep says ""Oh hey, here's an ad..."" On the the 3/15/69 show  these 5 minutes are taken up by Shep playing the jews harp and talking about gorillas being fingerprinted.

The two shows come together again and Shep reads an ad for professional landlords and talks about doing Uncle Tom's Cabin in school.

Right after he says ""Oh - high point in drama!"" about 45 seconds is cut where he plays 'reality sounds' (a train) and mentions it being Saturday.

They both pick up together where he starts to sing 'Bill Bailey' and continue in sync until he says ""This is WOR""

The 3/15/69 show has him continue to poke fun at WOR and then do a plug for the upcoming FDU show on 3/18/69. The 12/9/70 show has a commercial for Nat Sherman's.

They pick up together again briefly when he says ""Please Tony..."" and he plays Bill Baily for about 23 seconds. The next part of the 3/15/69 show is cut where Shep asks if anyone knows who Bill Bailey was and then plays more of the music.

Again they both pick up together as he says ""I have a listener here who asked me a question"" The show continues uncut fro the remainder except for one other line. As he starts to tell the story of being frozen in ice, he asks Tony ""Did I ever tell you that story Tony?"" The next line - "" I don't think I did."" is cut out.",

I should know, because I attended both the university and Shep's performance, where I made the mistake of asking my childhood idol a post-concert question he didn't like.  I was shocked when he quickly dismissed me as a ""turkey"" in front of the audience and my date/future wife.  By now, though, after 38 years of marriage, I think she agrees with him.

Also, I'm pretty sure that we actually saw him at SUNY SB in 1970, not 1968, since I didn't meet my wife until then and, as I said, we saw him there together.

""The Art of Head Thumping"" - Shep demonstrates his head thumping expertise to the music of The Smith Street Society Jazz Band.

Shep tells about his own experience with a camel. Coming home through the back alley that ran behind the houses, Shep discovers that in one of the garages is a camel which belongs to a magician. He starts feeding it the leftover peanut butter and jelly sandwich he had for lunch every day. After several months, one day he eats his whole sandwich and comes by empty handed. The camel is not amused and takes a big bite out of his new sheepskin coat. Shep's mother accuses him of lying when he tells her how the camel bit his coat, so he blames it on Flick. She sticks a bar of soap in Shep's mouth and calls Flick's mother. (See notes)","Soap in mouth:
This basic concept was used in A Christmas Story. In stead of getting the soap in the mouth for lying, it was because of the cursing. The phone call is made to Schwartz's mother instead of Flick's.

This is a re-run of the 9-22-69 show. Commercials have been added and when he reads the article about the stink bomb in the joke shop, in the 1969 show he metions the year, which is cut out of the 1971 show. There are also a lot of other edits here and there to free up time for the commercials. In the minute before the commercials there is a part in the 1971 show that is not in the 1969 version including the WOR ID, but is obviously part of the 'original' recording. Then the commercials are edited in. (Approx 2 minutes) Listening to the 1969 show you can hear the spot where something has been edited out right where the commercials would be plus about 15 seconds right before - including the WOR ID. Maybe the commercials were cut by the person recording? But why the part right before since it is still part of the story he was telling and then the WOR ID.

The rest of the show is dedicated to frogs.

He reads the following poems about frogs:
""The Frog"" by Hilaire Belloc
""Warty Bliggens the Toad"" by Don Marquis
""The Arrogant Frog and the Superior Bull"" by Guy Wetmore Carryl

Shep tells about the time in Miss Crystal Reeder's biology class when he was partnered with Pearl (Arauz) to dissect a frog.  He did all of the work, but she got a better grade.

He closes with a story from the Wall Street Journal detailing the shortage of frogs used for frog legs because many are being shipped to college campuses to be dissected.

During the show he mentions reading a book by Thorne Smith, but can't remember the title.  The book was ""The Stray Lamb"".",,"[Ryan Priest - 1/19/2017]
I initially thought this show might be mis-dated because the story about the starling appears in a number of newspapers in January 1970.  However, the commercials for ShopRite and TV Guide confirmed this was from 1971.  ShopRite didn't begin its ""Can-Can Sale"" until 1971.  Also, the TV Guide issue being advertised mentioned Flip Wilson on the cover, which indeed was from this week in 1971.  I also noticed that the music used wasn't listed on your music page.  I was able to identify one cut using a Google app on my phone.  The second cut was from the same artist, but I haven't pinned down the title yet.
[Jim] You may be right. If the show was re-run in 1971, the commercials would have been updated."

Shep spends the show describing the process of writing a book and getting it published.

He talks about writing in the first person - the ""I"" form and how fiction is semi-autobiographical in that it projects an image into what the writer has seen and experienced. It results in an amalgam form not of specific incidents, but of what could have happened in certain situations.

The book was 3 years in the writing and once it it sent to the publisher it goes through a long process to get published. It is in the contract how many free copies an author gets - 6 copies. The book goes through a design process, where an artist designs the book itself. Bindings, color, paper, type, and the layouts of the pages. Another artist does the dust jacket. When it is all designed, it goes to the factory to be printed and 'built'. Decisions are made as to when it will be published - spring or fall and on what date. 

He mentions that there are writers and readers. Readers read, and Writers write but seldom read.*  He thinks out a story before writing. He thinks out a beginning, a middle, and an end. Only then does he start writing. and once he's done writing, he's done and puts it out of his mind. He moves on to the next thing.","He says he's a second baseman. In many other shows he mentions being a third baseman.

Herb Squire - engineer

*I remember in one show Shep (the writer) talked about his obsession with reading everything he could get his hands on. Even cereal boxes.",

Drugs and drinking amongst todays kids - cheap wine is the current craze, the type of California wine you use to keep your radiator from freezing.

Poor Richards Almanac, the most moralistic book written was by Ben Franklin, another man who liked his drink.

Shep tells about Mrs Scott, the neighbor across the street who used to collect all the baseballs his into her yard, threatening to call the cops. She even wore a fielder's mit.

She had a Spitz named Rocky that always barked. One day Rocky grabbed Mrs Scott by the ankle and bites her. Seems that Mrs Scott also had a rabbit hutch in the yard. The rabbit food used to drop through the bottom of the cage onto the ground below. There is would ferment in the sun and rain. Rocky discovered this and use to get drunk eating the fermented pellets. One day someone cleaned out under the cage and Rocky couldn't get high and after a couple of days of a hangover. He had a head the size of a watermelon, so he bit Mrs Scott.","Shep notes that ""Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories"" is listed in the Time Magazine best seller list under non-fiction.

Another year they marched behind the sanitation workers. The float featured water sprinklers which would spray detergent into the air - and all over Wilbur Duckworth! He just kept marching, never missing a beat and occasionally his baton would be seen rising above the cloud of detergent.

Shep claims to keep a photo of Duckworth in his center desk drawer for inspiration.","Shep keeps mixing up the names.

Building planes is a guy thing. He's never seen a girl interested in building model planes. Boys vs. Girls - Romanticism  vs. Sentimentalism. 
The first plane he built was a ""Stinson Reliant"" which his mother broke ""a little bit"" when she dusted the room. (Remember the Leg Lamp and how it was broken in A Christmas Story?)

Aerial Photography - kids send a camera up 1,000 feet attached to a balloon to take pictures and the string breaks. 

Shep and Schwartz build a model of the ""Flying Quaker"" in the basement. They buy it for $15 after the prices was reduced from $21, and work together in Shep's basement assembling it. Finally it is ready, and they bring it outside, run a few tests of the engine, and then get ready for the maiden flight. The plane takes off and climbs to about 1,000 feet in a spiraling left turn. Suddenly it straightens out and takes off, climbing even higher. Everyone jumps into the car and they chase the plane down highway 41, through fields and used car lots, only to watch it fade off into the sunset never to be seen again. ",,

A few days later the same guy comes in, sits down as ifnothing ever happened and greets everyone.

Shep likes the cerial that gets shot out of a cannon. When he was young and had not much money, he would order a boxof the cerial in the diner for breakfast and keep pouring the half and half into the box and drinking it. He would consume almost a whole quart with every little box of cerial. The waiter caught on and began to give him the half and half in little portions. So Shep switched to another diner and on the second day the waiter says 'Ain't you that guy that goes around drinking all the half and half?' and gives it to him in a little cup., which proces there is an underground amongst quick order chefs.

Shep asks for a caller who knows the secret password. Immediately someone calls to say ""Excelsior"". Shep then says the origin of the password is the poem ""Excelsior"" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.",,

When the plane turned back and landed in Detroit, she hesitated about jumping from the top of the escape slide; a flight attendant had to push her out. Kaminsky slipped at the bottom and cut her foot to the bone.

Beauty of Comiskey Park - looking down at playing field before the game - ""pregnant with possibilities - the grass, white lines, foul lines angling off, fantastic green, enormous cliff of the stadium...""

A baseball outing with the ""Old Man"" at age 6 to a double header on a hot July Sunday against the Yankees at Comiskey Park is the subject of a story forming Shep's whole attitude toward sports.

The Old Man leads a group of about 20 anti Gehrig fanatics using  his ""tremendous diaphragm"" with jeers of ""Lou, you bum!"" at their seats about 5 feet inside the foul line at upper deck right field. Gehrig nails one about 30 feet behind them, and scores three runs. The ""boos"" continue with ""eyeballs bulging!"" Three innings later Gehrig slams one on a direct line to the Old Man which hits the railing just below him. The OM  becomes ""white as a sheet"" realizing that Gehrig was aiming for him! ""The next one will decapitate us!"" He felt responsible for the defeat of the White Sox that day for goading Gehrig into a superhuman effort, and shuts up for two games for fear of being hit. ""Kinda took the wind out of the OM as a boobird"" - until the next game with hated Cleveland!","Shep talks about becoming a Yankee fan through the back door, ""because the Yankees represented the avenging wrath that would come out of New York periodically and decimate the White Sox... They were so fantastic that you couldn't help but go out and watch them!"" 

This story was used in the 1985 Jean Shepherd's America Series in an episode called ""Chicago, Chicago That Toddlin' Town""",

Stories that have influenced us as kids.

The cave man period of life. What kid drama was based on a cave man? 

Wizard of Oz - Shep asks a group of trivia questions about the story. What city? What road?

Visiting a museum with Miss Robinette. Looking at the cave man exhibit. A family of cave people. She pointed out that these were our ancestors. Without them we wouldn't even exist.",,"I think that the Pete Delaney date for the show in question is correct, that is, 11-21-72. Remember, (based on your note) that Shepherd made the statement that it is the day before Thanksgiving. Since the show was at 10:15 to 11:00 pm, the ""day"" which was two days before Thanksgiving is in all practicality over and completed! That makes his comment that it is the day before Thanksgiving plausible in my opinion for a 11-21-72 date (late at night!). 
Think of it this way - If it really was within a hour or two of Thanksgiving (that is, 10:30 pm or so on 11-22-72), would any one really say that it is the ""day before Thanksgiving?"" 
     All this, of course, raises the question of the validity of the date of  11-21-72 ""Without them you would not have existed."" As it turns out, it was a tossup whether to date this show as 11-21-72 or 11-20-72. Perhaps, I made the wrong guess. Here is my reasoning as to why it could just as well be 11-20-72. The five inch reels of tape I got from Larry Krewer always had four shows on them - two in one direction and two more when the reels were turned over and wound back to the original reel (standard mono half track recordings). Larry's Dad, who taped these shows, always taped the second show of each side of the tape immediately after the first, with no filler audio inbetween. But when the second show was recorded, he just let the tape record through to the end and got anywhere between three to eight minutes or so of Lester Smith's 11:00 pm news after the Shepherd show at the tail end of the tape. The second show on the first side of the tape was dated as Friday, November 17th, 1972, based on the news. If the second show  on the second side of the reel is convincingly dated as Nov. 22 (which I feel it is), then the first show on the second side of the reel is either Monday or Tuesday the 20th or 21st - a tossup since there is no news broadcast to nail it down. But since Pete Delaney marked the show in question as the 21st, and we can justify the ""day before Thanksgiving"" dilemna for that show based on my discussion above, then we can safely move ""Without them you could not have existed!"" to Monday, November 20th, 1972."

'Have you actually ever seen anyone use an electric carving knife? I knew someone whpo took off the knife and put a hack saw blade into it.'",,"Per Lowell Thelin - I checked my notes for the 11-22-72 show. ""Turtle on the Runway"" was one of the shows I got from Larry Krewer here in Clfton, and it also had the Lester Smith news following the show which gave me some clues. Regarding this, the New York Times stated ""... there will be a break in talks Nov. 22 so Kissinger can fly to Brussels to see Indonesian President Suharto.""
Lester Smith said on WOR, ""He (Kissinger) is in Brussels, Belgium tonight talking with Indonesia President Suharto on supervising a cease fire... 
Earlier today, Dr. Kissinger and North Vietnam top government man LeDocTow (sp?) again discussed peace terms, this time for four hours. ...the talks took place outside Paris. Talks resume tomorrow. {Implies that talks were held up during Nov. 22nd when Kissinger made his short flight from Paris to Brussels, but that Kissinger was returning back to Paris for the 23rd and that talks would continue then} My conclusion from this is that ""Turtle on the Runway has to be 11-22-72.

Salute to the New Mexico House of Representatives which has voted to repeal an old law which allows a husband to kill his wife if he finds her in bed with her lover. The vote was 61-6.

Mr. Lincoln was one of the leading Jews Harp players in his day.

Politics always provided some sort of entertainment following a speech. Lincoln would often provide his own, and come back out onto the stage to play his Jews Harp. While in the White House, late at night, he would play for his friends.

While in High School, Shep played the B Flat Sousaphone in the High School Concert Band. During an assembly one year, celebrating Lincoln's birthday, not all goes as planned. Sitting in the band in the front of the auditorium, he can smell this familiar smell. The curtain goes up and there stands Abe Lincoln on the stage. He continues to smell that smell. Lincoln speaks: ""Four score and seven years ago . . ."" he stops, and then starts again. ""Four score and seven years ago . . . "" he stops again. What is that smell? He starts again, but he is swaying back and forth. Shep recognizes the smell - Uncle Carl. . . His drunken Uncle Carl! Abe Lincoln is bombed. The curtain quickly drops and Miss Fife takes over the assembly, telling about her recent vacation.

They kept them in a canning jar, but they would transport the roach in a small matchbox. One day in class Shep had  the box out to look at his favorite roach Clarence, and Miss Breyfogal caught him. She took it away saying that he should not be playing with matches and stuck it in her bag. At the end of class she gave the box back to him and it was empty! Clarence was gone!",,

The commercial for TV Guide referenced an issue that is listed as May 11-18.  Also, the recording I heard has a snippet of John Wingate's news at the tail end.  It features a commercial for an event that will take place Monday, May 13.  Wingate also teases a story about an 87-year-old man who rides his motorcycle daily.  I've found some articles in newspaper archives that feature 87-year-old Earl Gregg of Ohio who rides his motorcycle around a dirt track at his home.  Most papers feature it on May 7, 1974.  While I can't garner an exact date from this, it can probably be narrowed to sometime during the week of May 6-11."

The timelessness of Shep:

If you listen to Shep regularly, as I do, thanks to Max, Flick Lives
and The Brass Figlagee podcasts, you must be struck with how
appropriate and relevant many of his programs are for today, despite
their 30-40 year age.

Last night I listened to a show he did on October 29, 1974. This is
the 45th anniversary of the great the stock market crash in 1929,
which many think was the harbinger of the Great Depression. It was
eerie listening to him knowing that the DJIA dropped below 8000, a six
year low and nearly 7000 points below its high a mere two years ago. 
His commentary was not dated, and could have been done almost as is
live last night without losing a beat. 

Lester Smith's news preceded him with a quote from the President
(Ford) that his policies were up to handing the economic problems.

Shep played ""The bear missed the train"" throughout this show, as the
theme of the 1974 economic woes, which included 13% inflation and
declining stock prices. 

He said he was always ignorant of the stock market and, as a result,
was not invested in securities. In this case, ""ignorqance is bliss""
he said. A friend who was always chiding hm for not investing had a
framed copy of the New York Times front page of Oct. 29, 1929 on his
wall. Shep said that was like a Kodiak bear collecting bear skin
rugs. This is the guy, Shep said, who is often under his desk with a
bottle of Jack Daniels as the market drops.

Two points he made that stuck with me is how people don't learn from
history and always want to think that the time they are living in is
the most critical and important, and that they think of the past as a
""simpler"" time with less challenges. 

The Waltons came in for a drubbing as a romanticized view of life in
the distant and rural past. ""If I see John boy again I will fwow up,""
Shep said.

He talked about how historians and movie makers create our images of
the past out of whole cloth, and that people resist accepting a true
rendition because it challenges the view that they like to have.

He said imagine if Dick Cavett could interview U.S. Grant about the
civil war. Historians would be up in arms because he would say a lot
of things that were at odds with their writings. ""What does he know?""
they'd shout. ""He doesn't have a Pulitzer Prize in history.""

The kind of stuff that helped shape my views at the tender age of 15.

Perhaps we can have a thread about Shep shows from the way past that
connect to the present. It's been a long time since we've talked in
depth about the guy and his work.",

Gives example of friend who accidentally dated a check for many years previous, a year marked by trauma. He feels like the year 1975 is science fiction-like. He makes new resolutions, he's going to go straight:

1)  He will stop making snide remarks.  Could at least become Mike Douglas by 1976.

2)  He will practice liking Victor Borge.  Will watch old movie clips.

3)  He will practice laughing at Phyllis Diller.  That will be tough.

4) He will practice laughing at  Don Rickles.  Very hard.  In his new image, he could do a panel talk show. 

5) He will learn to love Zsa Zsa Gabor.

6)  He will systematically erase his long term memory.  This will keep him out of trouble when people contradict themselves. Best memory would be very long term memory so that you can talk about stuff that doesn't matter anymore.  Wants a button activated memory eraser.

7)  He will work very hard on his intolerance and hate. Development of these attributes will help him to be a top editorial writer for New York magazine. No point in being a nebbish or a true, loving human being.  Never pays off. 

8)  He will learn to respect critics because critics are becoming more important than what they criticize.

9)  He is going to work on pragmatism so that he can get away with rotten things like John Dean.  Should be a full blown pragmatist 
10)  He will start giving time continually on his show.

11)  He will do interviews on his show.  

12)  He will install 25 phones and produce each call that comes in.

13)  He will play popular records.

14)  He will control his voice so that he sounds sincere during the commercials. He will deliver commercials with ringing note of total sincerity based on honest and proper humility.

15)  He will say good things about radio in spite of all evidence to the contrary.

16)  He will work on proper gratitude.

17)  He will practice pretending to like cats.

18)  He will learn to walk respectfully, not aggressively or ""macho"".

19)  He will learn to respect his ""betters"".

20)  He will  to ""tug at the forelock"".

21)  He will  get rid of the Jew's harp and kazoo, no longer sing ridiculous songs. But sings ""The Bear Missed The Train"" one last time. Then he tosses out the instruments.

22)  He will not ever mention sports.  Just Bobby Fisher and chess.

23)  He will steer away from mentioning any cultural differences between Midwest and east.

24)  He will pretend that he enjoys Broadway musicals.

In Michigan, Shep spends ten days in a cabin he rented from a farmer who owned 500 acres. It was right on the shore of Rifle Lake. After about three days he is sitting in the boat on the lake fishing when all of a sudden something big and smooth rolled right next to the boat from out of the black water and then disappears. Everyday it kept seeming darker. After a few days Shep is listening to the portable radio, and walks out of the cabin into the night... except it was 11:00am! It was pitch dark and you could see stars. By 3:00 it began to get ligh, by 4:30 it was twilight and by 5:00 it was getting dark again.

He describes a bus tour he took through Dublin and compares it to a bus tour through New York City. The tour guide narrates the tour by quoting famous scholars unlike the more descriptive ones in America.

Shep recounts his comment from the previous trip about how in the early morning while lying in his room he could hear the footsteps of the people walking out on the street.

He tells about driving through  the Connemara countryside, coming across some ponies and a flock of sheep along the road. There are hundreds of small one lane roads criss crossing the countryside, populated with small houses without electricity, using only kerosene. 

At one point they pull over to  check the map and suddenly a donkey pokes its head in through the car window. Soon they're surrounded by 25 more of the curious animals. As they slowly drive away, the donkeys begin to follow.

They arrive in Clifden where the first two men to fly the Atlantic nonstop, on June 15, 1919, had 'landed' their plane. What had appeared to be a grassy field, turned out to be a bog.

In Clifden Shep visits a samll shop where the old shopkeeper tells them of how he witnessed the landing and even shows them a piece of the wing from the plane, signed by the pilots.","Tape verbally dated

NY Jets singing Jingle Bells with Shepherd's Jew's Harp accompaniment

Shep is thankful tonight that he is not in the army. Being a ""yardbird"" is a ""soul searing"" experience, and a particular Christmas Eve in the army is recalled. He had been stationed in the Ozarks, hundreds of miles from any major city. A week before Christmas a notice had been posted - ""One-third of all personnel of every operating company will be confined to base on 
Christmas holiday."" On December 23rd, the list of those leaving for home was read, and Shep, and Gasser, among others, were not on it. That afternoon, the entire company trudges to the ""pole line construction practice yard."" This is 5000 flat acres of mud with a ""great bristling forest of stripped telephone poles"" of sizes ranging from ""little fifteen footers all the way up to sixty footers. They kind of marched to the horizon like a denuded forest that had been hit by some terrible blight."" Company K was going to practice putting up equipment on telephone poles. They wore ""belts with clips, wire cutters, flashlight, continuity tester, medical case, and sidearm"" all on the outside of their raincoats. ""Climbers"" were spurs worn at your instep, and if somehow they didn't hold while you were climbing down, an extremely dangerous situation resulted. It was best to hit the belt safety catch at this point and push away so that you were not held close to the pole to be impaled by gigantic splinters, which could be fatal!
Shep climbs a sixty foot pole with Edwards, and Gasser on poles on either side. When Shep starts singing Jingle Bells, the others chime in, but they are interrupted by the southern red-headed corporal GI shouting ""At ease up there!""

The mood at chow is dismal. Fried liver and cabbage salad are served with pickled beets, and purple Kool Aid. Next morning Kowalski gives the order ""Since it's Christmas, let's knock off everything through Christmas day!"" No one was in the mess hall so they could cook up anything they wanted! Shep's huge meal of seven fried eggs, a slab of bacon, and all the coffee he could eat was interrupted by Gasser's observation. ""You seen that bulletin board, Shep? Guess who's picking up guard duty?"" At eight that night, Shep dresses in his raincoat, gas mask, leggings, M1, and cartridge belt and takes his guard post at the end of the rifle range. Every half hour the officer of the guard would drive by in a Jeep with the ""rain slanting in the headlights."" At the end of the watch, the officer calls out ""Take it easy soldier, and by the way, Merry Christmas!"" But tonight Shep surmises that somewhere even that officer is saying to himself ""It's Christmas. Thank God I ain't in the army!""","""A Great Show"" Best to listen to in windy snow or rain! LT",

There are 2 shows dated 10-7-76. I suspect one is wrong - possibly the 8th. No way to tell unless there are hints in the show.

Max to Jim
It seems likely that the first show listed as 10/07 would be correct, the next show (Police Calls) would be somewhere between 10/08 and the next date, 10/12. Upon checking the reel, I find that the date stamps that had previously been recorded onto the tapes are no longer there, but preceding the first show on the reel (10/07) there is the end of a newscast followed by an announcement that Shep and Carlton Fredericks would NOT be on that night. Since the last show on the previous reel is 10/05, that would make the 10/07 date correct for the first show.  If the next date is right, then the second 10/07 can only be 10/08 or 10/11 since the other dates would be the weekend - perhaps there's a mention of it being Friday?",

He invites them all into his house ""to show them something"" Curiosity gets them and so they follow him into his house into the basement. He takes a Prince Albert can out of the cabinet. He takes the top off and in the can is a wad of cotton. In the wad of cotton is a finger. All brown and dry - with a fingernail. It was John Dillinger's little finger. 

Three months later outside the school the go out to the swamp. Sitting amongst the weeds is a shack. Nailed to the side of the shack was a hand! They run back to the school and tell the janitor, Mr. Sanderson, about the hand. They tell the principal who calls the police. They come and it turns out to be a glove nailed to the wall.

Shep describes a red brick firehouse with gargoyles. No one makes building with them anymore. An old church in Holland is rebuilt with gargoyles of Donald Cuck, Pluto, and Snoopy. Gargoyles in life - people you are involved with and how did you get involved with them. What happened?

Shep plays a bunch of commercials on the kazzoo and quizes everyone in the control booth to guess them.

Most people are born with 2 chunks of lead on each side of their head to keep the cottage cheese in.

People's success due to short comings.
A very successful man goes through life with a painful toenail. They find he has a small tumor and it is removed, eliminating the pain. He is no longer driven by the pain and is pennyless in no time. He has lost all ambition.

Shep rushes home excited, deciding not to sell seeds for school that day. He heads to Patty's house and knocks on her door. Her mother answers the door and asks Shep what he wants. He tells her to tell Patty he is here. Patty tells her mother from the next room that they don't need any seeds. Shep is confused and Patty seems to know nothing asking what he wants. He fakes it and asks about the math homework and then leaves.

As he leaves the house, he hears giggling coming from under Patty's porch. Schwartz yells out April fools!","This was the last WOR broadcast by Shep, ending over 20 years on the station. He made no special remarks to signify the end. He mentioned leaving radio on his March 23rd show. He makes a quick reference to collecting teeth which was one of the stories.

This show is a rerun from 4-1-68

From Laurie Squire:
In the last couple of months of Jean's time at WOR he did very few live shows and left it up to me to pick any show for air. I would listen through a tape for any glaring problems, have the old spots edited out and new ones inserted. I tried to choose shows that aired around the same time of the month so the April Fool's tape was chosen for that reason (I know, sounds bad but...). As to why he didn't do a last live show, that decision also was not up to him (but, for the record, he had no desire to do an ""official"" final live one): typically (not always but often) when an on-air talent was removed, the WOR management at the time did not want anyone's final show to be live out of fear that something untoward might happen or be said.",

x108,,Hartwest Productions,,,,Business Ventures,Syndicated Shows,,,,"Hartwest Productions was a syndicator back in the 1960's who maintained one of the most extensive programming-production departments in the syndication field. They supplied sydicated shows such as The Joe Pyne Show, the Paul Gibson Show, the Barry Gray Show, and the Jean Shepherd Show to radio staions across the country. 

According to the Films Around the World website Shepherd recorded a number of shows for Hartwest for syndication. About 200 hours of shows, which should be close to 300 individual shows, are currently in possession of Films Around the World. The shows were recorded without commercials, with Shep only announcing ""lets break for a commercial"". Some shows had an open mike before the theme and you can hear Shep talking with the engineers.

Based on ads and articles in Broadcast Magazine, Hartwest was supplying shows to WHEC in Rochester, NY as early as November 9, 1964 and as late as March 15, 1965. Supposedly they were broadcast daily which means that over the 4 month period about 80 shows were aired on WHEC alone. It is not known how many other stations carried these. Also it is not know which shows were aired. Were the shows that aired part of the group of 200 hours in possession of FATW? Or were there more?",,
